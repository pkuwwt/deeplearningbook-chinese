    Abstract = "A fundamental challenge in speech recognition is the discrimination of the acoustic vectors characterizing each speech time-slot into classes of sub-word units. The most popular technique relies on hidden Markov models (HMM) but alternative models could make use of linear or non-linear discriminant functions and also Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP). A common property of these techniques is their learning ability. However, the advantage of discriminant functions and multilayer perceptrons is their possibility to force simultaneously the acceptance of a vector into its own class and its rejection by the rival classes. Ideally, this classification relies on a logical decision with a score invariant for any vector in a given class. Generally, classes are not linearly separable. As linear discriminant functions are not flexible enough to attain both objectives, suitable non-linear discriminant functions could approximate logical decision and achieve non-linear separation. For that purpose, multilayer perceptrons are particularly powerful tools because of their possibility to approximate a very wide range of non-linear functions with a rather restricted set of parameters. The main properties of MLP are pointed out and illustrated by simple examples. The possibility of including discriminant principles in a Dynamic Time Warping process and in a Viterbi-like training is shown. The discriminant properties of HMM, linear discriminant functions and MLP are compared from the point of view of local labeling of the acoustic vectors and of the global recognition. Finally, a phoneme based real task application (50 phonemes, 1000 vocabulary words) is described. It makes use of a particular MLP, based on the NETtalk architecture, and shows how the non-linear discriminant functions and the consideration of the temporal context dependence of the acoustic vectors are useful for the phonetic speech labeling.",

    Abstract = {Since its publication in 1949, D.O. Hebb's, The Organization of Behavior has been one of the most influential books in the fields of psychology and neuroscience. However, the original edition has been unavailable since 1966, ensuring that Hebb's comment that a classic normally means "cited but not read" is true in his case. This new edition rectifies a long-standing problem for behavioral neuroscientists--the inability to obtain one of the most cited publications in the field. The Organization of Behavior played a significant part in stimulating the investigation of the neural foundations of behavior and continues to be inspiring because it provides a general framework for relating behavior to synaptic organization through the dynamics of neural networks. D.O. Hebb was also the first to examine the mechanisms by which environment and experience can influence brain structure and function, and his ideas formed the basis for work on enriched environments as stimulants for behavioral development. References to Hebb, the Hebbian cell assembly, the Hebb synapse, and the Hebb rule increase each year. These forceful ideas of 1949 are now applied in engineering, robotics, and computer science, as well as neurophysiology, neuroscience, and psychology--a tribute to Hebb's foresight in developing a foundational neuropsychological theory of the organization of behavior.},

    Abstract = "Neural machine translation, a recently proposed approach to machine translation based purely on neural networks, has shown promising results compared to the existing approaches such as phrase-based statistical machine translation. Despite its recent success, neural machine translation has its limitation in handling a larger vocabulary, as training complexity as well as decoding complexity increase proportionally to the number of target words. In this paper, we propose a method that allows us to use a very large target vocabulary without increasing training complexity, based on importance sampling. We show that decoding can be efficiently done even with the model having a very large target vocabulary by selecting only a small subset of the whole target vocabulary. The models trained by the proposed approach are empirically found to outperform the baseline models with a small vocabulary as well as the LSTM-based neural machine translation models. Furthermore, when we use the ensemble of a few models with very large target vocabularies, we achieve the state-of-the-art translation performance (measured by BLEU) on the English-{\textgreater}German translation and almost as high performance as state-of-the-art English-{\textgreater}French translation system.",

    Abstract = "We consider training a deep neural network to generate samples from an unknown distribution given i.i.d. data. We frame learning as an optimization minimizing a two-sample test statistic---informally speaking, a good generator network produces samples that cause a two-sample test to fail to reject the null hypothesis. As our two-sample test statistic, we use an unbiased estimate of the maximum mean discrepancy, which is the centerpiece of the nonparametric kernel two-sample test proposed by Gretton et al. (2012). We compare to the adversarial nets framework introduced by Goodfellow et al. (2014), in which learning is a two-player game between a generator network and an adversarial discriminator network, both trained to outwit the other. From this perspective, the MMD statistic plays the role of the discriminator. In addition to empirical comparisons, we prove bounds on the generalization error incurred by optimizing the empirical MMD.",

Early attempts at explaining this phenomenon focused on nonlinearity and overfitting. We argue instead that the primary cause of neural networks' vulnerability to adversarial perturbation is their linear nature. This explanation is supported by new quantitative results while giving the first explanation of the most intriguing fact about them: their generalization across architectures and training sets. Moreover, this view yields a simple and fast method of generating adversarial examples. Using this approach to provide examples for adversarial training, we reduce the test set error of a maxout network on the MNIST dataset.",

We frame learning as an optimization minimizing a two-sample test statistic---informally speaking, a good generator network produces samples that cause a two-sample test to fail to reject the null hypothesis. As our two-sample test statistic, we use an unbiased estimate of the maximum mean discrepancy, which is the centerpiece of the nonparametric kernel two-sample test proposed by Gretton et al. (2012). We compare to the adversarial nets framework introduced by Goodfellow et al. (2014), in which learning is a two-player game between a generator network and an adversarial discriminator network, both trained to outwit the other. From this perspective, the MMD statistic plays the role of the discriminator. In addition to empirical comparisons, we prove bounds on the generalization error incurred by optimizing the empirical MMD.",

    abstract = "A fundamental challenge in speech recognition is the discrimination of the acoustic vectors characterizing each speech time-slot into classes of sub-word units. The most popular technique relies on hidden Markov models (HMM) but alternative models could make use of linear or non-linear discriminant functions and also Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP). A common property of these techniques is their learning ability. However, the advantage of discriminant functions and multilayer perceptrons is their possibility to force simultaneously the acceptance of a vector into its own class and its rejection by the rival classes. Ideally, this classification relies on a logical decision with a score invariant for any vector in a given class. Generally, classes are not linearly separable. As linear discriminant functions are not flexible enough to attain both objectives, suitable non-linear discriminant functions could approximate logical decision and achieve non-linear separation. For that purpose, multilayer perceptrons are particularly powerful tools because of their possibility to approximate a very wide range of non-linear functions with a rather restricted set of parameters. The main properties of MLP are pointed out and illustrated by simple examples. The possibility of including discriminant principles in a Dynamic Time Warping process and in a Viterbi-like training is shown. The discriminant properties of HMM, linear discriminant functions and MLP are compared from the point of view of local labeling of the acoustic vectors and of the global recognition. Finally, a phoneme based real task application (50 phonemes, 1000 vocabulary words) is described. It makes use of a particular MLP, based on the NETtalk architecture, and shows how the non-linear discriminant functions and the consideration of the temporal context dependence of the acoustic vectors are useful for the phonetic speech labeling.",

However, the original edition has been unavailable since 1966, ensuring that Hebb's comment that a classic normally means "cited but not read" is true in his case. This new edition rectifies a long-standing problem for behavioral neuroscientists--the inability to obtain one of the most cited publications in the field. The Organization of Behavior played a significant part in stimulating the investigation of the neural foundations of behavior and continues to be inspiring because it provides a general framework for relating behavior to synaptic organization through the dynamics of neural networks. D.O. Hebb was also the first to examine the mechanisms by which environment and experience can influence brain structure and function, and his ideas formed the basis for work on enriched environments as stimulants for behavioral development. References to Hebb, the Hebbian cell assembly, the Hebb synapse, and the Hebb rule increase each year. These forceful ideas of 1949 are now applied in engineering, robotics, and computer science, as well as neurophysiology, neuroscience, and psychology--a tribute to Hebb's foresight in developing a foundational neuropsychological theory of the organization of behavior.},

    abstract = "Neural machine translation, a recently proposed approach to machine translation based purely on neural networks, has shown promising results compared to the existing approaches such as phrase-based statistical machine translation. Despite its recent success, neural machine translation has its limitation in handling a larger vocabulary, as training complexity as well as decoding complexity increase proportionally to the number of target words. In this paper, we propose a method that allows us to use a very large target vocabulary without increasing training complexity, based on importance sampling. We show that decoding can be efficiently done even with the model having a very large target vocabulary by selecting only a small subset of the whole target vocabulary. The models trained by the proposed approach are empirically found to outperform the baseline models with a small vocabulary as well as the LSTM-based neural machine translation models. Furthermore, when we use the ensemble of a few models with very large target vocabularies, we achieve the state-of-the-art translation performance (measured by BLEU) on the English-{\textgreater}German translation and almost as high performance as state-of-the-art English-{\textgreater}French translation system.",
